Demo notebooks of quantum algorithms.

### Deutsch's Problem
The algorithm asks user to choose one of the 4 functions mapping from {0,1} to {0,1} as the black-box function. It then decides if the function is constant in one query.

### Berstein-Vazirani Problem
The algorithm asks user to choose a coefficient. It constructs a corresponding oracle and decides the coefficient in one query.
